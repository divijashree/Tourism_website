The largest city in Jharkhand, Jamshedpur is an aesthetically planned township with an appealing infrastructure and landscape. Juxtaposed against the beautiful Dalma Hills, Jamshedpur is the world's eighth-largest steel manufacturing company, along with being India's first planned city.

The town of Jamshedpur was named after Jamshetiji Tata in 1919, the founder of the Tata industries that maintain public services and infrastructure of most parts of the city.

With its industrial growth, Jamshedpur has made its place in the map of world business along with playing a very important role in industrialising India. The founders day of Jamshedpur is celebrated on October 3 every year at Jubilee Park, which is decked up with lights and colours for the occasion.
